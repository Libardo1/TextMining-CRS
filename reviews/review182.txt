I was visiting London ZOO and decided to go to Pizza Hut. the nearest one was at Camden Town according to the net on my phone. But it turned out to be "Pizza Hut DELIVERY". The staff told me that there's a normal restaurant at Leicester Square. After one hour in the tube I finally reached my destination. The restaurant was extremely crowded (as always). I took an only free table and was waiting for waiter. I was waiting and waiting... After 25 minutes he finally appeared and took plates after previous customers. Then he took my order. He seemed to be ill and was rude. Maybe was angry with someone as well. The restaurant had mood lighting and was well decorated. I got my order. It was a typical Pizza Hut meal. Taste of my pizza was rather ok. Then I requested for a bill and had to wait 10 minutes for it. The same waiter came with bill to me. He even didn't say anything, just put it on the table...To sum up it was a standard Pizza Hut restaurant, but the service and problems with finding it on the net (they should do sth with their site) give it a lower rating.
