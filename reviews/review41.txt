they have the unlimited lunch time buffet at £7.50 which I thought sounded good the selection however was a bit disappointing & our milkshakes arrived some time after we have finished our food. it did not seem that busy so why the delay?we sat outside but the buffet was downstairs where we would have sat if we has knownthe staff seemed a lot chattier when we came to pay our bill was he after a tip?
