After arriving at the restaurant without a booking around 4PM on New Years Eve, we didn't expect to be seated and orders taken at all. In fact, we thought we would have been turned away.Nope.We were eating within 20 minutes of sitting down, and the pizza was lovely as ever. I can't fault it. The place was busy but staff were steaming through the visitors, so all was well.I would recommend this actively. If they can manage a busy NYE in the heart of London, I daresay any other day will be a breeze for them.
