We only went yesterday and it was great! We got there and decided to eat in Pizza Hut, after seeing that they had there all you eat buffet on, for a cheap price. We got there and it was bigger than expected, down the stairs where we had to wait for a seat for the 4 of us. The staff kept on telling us how long we would have to wait. The only downside to the place of waiting is that there was hardly any space to queue, it was right next to the toilets and the door so people kept on going past us, so there wasn't much space to go around. After getting our table, we ordered the drinks which we thought they were reasonable for the price. The plates were not really clean, but as it was so busy at the time they would of just quickly put them in the dishwasher, meaning they can't get off the food well enough. The pizza kept on going down quite quickly so it had to be replaced often. I found the pizza and pasta great and so was the salad bar! The staff were also helpful and happy, very reasonable price too for 3 adults and one child (12 and under). It was very clean too, we had a great time and if we went to London, we would defiantly go there again.
