I ordered a home delevery tonight. It was 30 minutes late and it was stone cold. I called up the pizza hut in woodford green, essex because they gave me a wrong pizza. After beinh put on hold for 5 minutes they said that they would send me out another pizza and give me £5 in vouchers as a sorry. half an hour went by with nothing, so I phones the manager back up again. He was really rude and said we was not getting another pizza and that the money off voucher was to replace the other pizza for next time. he the put down the phone on me!!!!! So we ended up with no pizza plus this cost 15pound but only got 5 pound back!!!!!! Will not use pizza hut in woodford green, rather go to dominos and pappa jones.
