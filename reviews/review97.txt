We love pizza hut, always have, been going with and without our children for years, where ever we travel in britain, we always manage to find one.. After a stop off in hemel hemstead, we found a pizza hut, there were 9 of us in total, including one child with autism, who just didnt want to come in... The staff were amazing, so helpful, the manageress anna in particular, she managed to get little chap into the resturant... And as usual we all had a fabulous meal, at an great price, my kids wouldnt want to celebrtate anywhere else.. Thanks to all the staff x x
