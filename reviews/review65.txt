I ordered a pizza online through Pizza Crap Hut website, the ordering process went well, was informed online that the delivery would be with me within 30 minutes, this was correct and I received the pizza. However I received the wrong food, it was cold congealed and in a disgusting mess. I made a telephone call to the branch of Pizza Hut and was basically informed that I was a liar and would have to make do with the pizza that I had received. The service I have received from pizza hit is far from what I expected, I will tell people about the bad experience I have had with this downright really poor company, will advise people not to use them and will certainly be advising people never to use them. My Facebook page will also publish the very bad experience I have had with Pizza Hut. WILL NEVER USE THIS SHOWER OF S@&£ EVER AGAIN. FINALLY THE ONE STAR RATING I GAVE, IF THIS SITE ALLOWED A MINUS RATING I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A MINUS FIVE STAR RATING. Very dissatisfied
