I went to the Oxford Street/Marble Arch branch of Pizza Hut recently (recently as in yesterday), and we ordered the Cheesy Garlic Bread and the Veggie Hot One Pizza. My mouth is watering as I am writing this. hmm....The Garlic Bread arrived and I ate it, and I said to my wife, this is the best garlic bread I have ever had. Apparently they are making the dough for the garlic bread on site and spreading the garlic butter on both sides. And you would not believe what difference it makes. I was loving every bite, and I said to my wife, should we order another one.Then the Pizza Arrived, and OMG what a Pizza, they made me believe I have never ever in my whole life had a pizza. The dough was made in house and it was truly heaven on a plate.Pizza Hut whatever you are doing to the savoury menu, hats off to you.HOWEVER, you have ruined my favourite desert. My Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is not wat it used to be. I have significantly disappointed, in the Hut for that. After all that amazing savoury food, to end the meal of a delight, and all we got was a flat tire on this beautiful journey. Pizza hut, please take my advise and "FIX IT" I would have been giving 5 stars, but you only get 4.The flavour which used to be there wasnt there anymore, it wasn't that hot, and the size of the dish was cut by at least 50% and the price was still the same. FIX IT, FIXT IT, FIX IT!Guys you are letting your Pizza down.
