I travelled recently to London with my 8 year old daughter. This Pizza Hut is so small, we were lead upstairs and they have jammed in as many tables as possible making it difficult to negotiate around tables and you feel like you can hear everyone's conversation around you whether you like it or not. The waitresses were fine, quite pleasant and we were served quickly. One thing that really annoyed me and spoiled my experience here was when it came time to pay the bill. The bill came to £16. When the waitress approached my table to take our dirty plates, I indicated to her that I wished to settle the bill and I gave the waitress the bill on the little black bill tray plus a £20 note. The waitress then disappeared towards the till and I waited and waited for her to return with my £4 change, but she never came back. As service was not included, I had intended to leave a £2 tip anyhow, but as it was, I got tired of waiting and just left so they got a £4 tip instead. I feel that it is a bit presumptuous of the waitress to just disappear with my money and not bother returning any change, £4 on a bill of only £16 seems like a bit of an excessive tip. Perhaps she got distracted or forgot? I'll never know....
