No personnel to greet people upon arriving led to people walking right in front of others and getting seated before the ones that were actually in line.Service was terribly slow. It took 25 mins to get our order under way and another 20 mins before food made it to the table. When you're on a schedule and with kids it makes the wait even longer.I wish I'd taken a picture of the cuttlery laid on the chair while the waiter was doing something else and then returned to the table to clean it and put the cuttlery on the table for the next people to eat... Before the cuttlery, the chair was occupied by a backpack... NO COMMENT! Will never go there again!
