I go to Pizza Hut with my family very regulary, for me, so far this is my favorite resturant to go to. Mainly because I can only really go to McDonalds and here because I have a serious nut allergy. The people here cater for allergies like mine, unlike many other places. The service is usually very good, but sometimes a litlle slow.. Due to them always being very busy when we go. The food is always perfect, except once.. When I had a takw away and obviously the food had not been checked properly and was burnt. - Will not have a take away again from there. The wait for the food is usually quite long but definatley worth it. The salad bar is usually very clean and no food is mixed together, most people wouldn't worry about that, but I have to because of my allergies. The staff are ALWAYS extremley helpful and I could never thank them enough for taking so much care and fetching the allergy books for me! I very often feel like a pain! But they always assure me that it's fine and what they want to do to help & understand. Overall everything is great except the long wait ocasinally, and the sticky tables! Lovely people and thank you very much to everyone at Pizza Hut Derby, Wyvern for helping us everytime and explaining all of the deals and helping save us money, would definaltey reccomend for a lovely family meal, or a peaceful evening out for a couple. Lovely, always felt welcome, good deals & Thankyou ever so much!
