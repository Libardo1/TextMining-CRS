On a Sunday after a visit to the National Gallery at 2 pm we were walking around and decided to stop for a quick bite. I remembered that Pizza Hut tends to be rather consistent in other countries we visited and reasonably value for money. Unfortunately this pizzeria was very disappointing. The older waiter was happy to send everybody downstairs despite the sunny day. We wanted to stay on the ground floor and we had to put our foot down on the table we chose. The wait for the pizza was long, the salad display was dirty and poorly refurbished (no decent olive oil). When I asked a waitress whether she could replenish on of the bottles, she looked at me as if I was bothering her unnecessarily. Only 1 young waiter was helpful and well mannered (sort of). They do seem not to get any formal training and act as they can. Bruschetta was 3.35, 1 large "Italian" pizza with extra topping £ 14.95 (in itself a reasonable taste) and 1 Pepsi in a glass with ice £ 2.35. So not too expensive apart from the drink. The older waiter dropped a fork on the floor and put it back on the cutlery tray. As he realised that I had seen him he then came back to remove the fork and take it to the kitchen. Later he sneezed and cleaned his nose with his hand and later on his trousers. In 1 word quite a disgusting experience. There are plenty of other options around Leicester Square and Shaftsbury Av.: just stay away from that Pizza Hut.
