There are different type of meals for two and for family which make it so affordable and easy to choose. We ordered the Family Vegi Pizza which contains two large pizzas, wedges and 2 liters soft drink. The seating area are well organized and well controlled by the reception young lady. The only disadvantage is the that it is located in the basement with many steps which make it very difficult to have a family takeaway order.
