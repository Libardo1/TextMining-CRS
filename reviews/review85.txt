My husband and I went to Pizza Hut Haymarket for something quick to eat before going to the theatre. The restaurant is small and cramped with the chairs so close to chairs on other tables you can barely sit down let alone move. The pizza was OK, nothing special but not awful either. My husband ordered the ice-cream factory but the machine wasn't working and they had hardly any of the toppings in stock anyway. I had the cookie dough ice-cream which was no way near as nice as it looks on the menu! We paid cash had to argue with the waitress that she owed us £10 change as she just took the money without looking at how much was there. My advice - go to Pizza Express across the road!
