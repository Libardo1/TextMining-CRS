We went to The Pizza Hut in Baker Street one evening after a long day in London, expecting the comfort and familiarity you normally expect to find in any Pizza Hut. Instead of being able to order a straightforward salad, though, there was now salad on demand and drinks on tap (welcomed by the children in the group) - but so much like a cheap, poor quiality Harvester. There was nothing available but pizza, with none of the other Italian inspired dishes available on the menu. The prices were out of this world with dinner costing over £60. The service was slow and very poor - there was no cutlery on the table and we had to ask for it. Part of the meal was served before the pizzas and we had to ask for that food to be kept warm until the pizzas were ready. Then they forgot to bring it when the pizzas finally arrived. The food was passable but this is definitely not somewhere to visit if you want reasonably priced food and good service.
