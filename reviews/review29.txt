We recently took a group of 40 teenagers to London and ended up eating here two days in a row. The first time we were booked and enjoyed a buffet which filled the students up and provided us with a good leisurely meal.We ended up being stranded the next day when our coach broke down and we had to wait 4 hours for a new one. I returned to the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate 40 of us again at peak time on a Saturday night and the staff went out of their way to make it happen. They were brilliant and managed to squeeze us in and provide good food again. Great service, thank you!
