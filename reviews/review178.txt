Quite literally the best there is, plus they don't always charge for the yummy ice cream factory, this place is the best restaurant in the world. I am referring to Pizza Huts in general. Free salad, yummy + medium pizza+excellent service (free ice cream factory sometimes)= Happy me. I love the staff at Pizza Hut, they are so polite and friendly, I go a least once a week and spend around 3 hours here, the best part is that it only costs 5 pounds for the deal above! Yummy!
