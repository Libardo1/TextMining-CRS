We had booked a table for 6pm as not sure how busy the hut would be, we arrived earlier, and the hut at 5 pm was empty, after a communication issue we were seated and the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful and polite. A rarity nowadays!The pizza's were lovely, the smallest pizza 9" was too big for me, and with the free unlimited salad was too stuffed for a yummy cookie dough and ice-cream desert. By 6 pm the hut was bursting, but the waiting staff, were still smiling, and being friendly. This location of hut is perfect for theatre land.
