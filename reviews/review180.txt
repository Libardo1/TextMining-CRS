My partner and i just want something easy as we was going to a show, the man at the door took us to our seats which was by the till the waiter just stood there listening to our converstation before we was even ready to order he was logged into the till wanting our order, we was really put on the spot he didn't even come to the table to take the order.He messed up out order and gave us our side dishes as starters both our pizza's where warm and not enjoyable, Then the waiter came a took our plates away when i still had pizza in my hand NOT GREAT!!!!
