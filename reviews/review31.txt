On arrival had to tell the staff where available tables were, also had to ask staff for cutlery as well as the bill.Whilst studying the menu it’s apparent they no longer sell small pizzas, so the kids menu came in handy.The toilets were extremely nasty (faeces stuck to the bowl, urine over the seat and floor, toilet tissue all over the floor) so had to turn back. It’s fair to say that the waitress weren’t receiving a single tip other than the mere fact that the toilets should be checked regularly and actually cleaned.The salad cart should have a few more options to include bread.
