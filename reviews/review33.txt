I ordered 2 large pizza's. One was a ham and pineapple on a base which had cheese rolls around it, it is referred to as the Cheesy Bites base. That pizza was okay. If I was rating this review on that pizza then I would give it about a 2. However, I did say I ordered 2 pizzas. The second pizza is the reason this review gets the score it does. The base was probably the best pizza base I have had. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name and it does not seem to be on the menu. However, I will do my best to describe it. It had sort of mini pizzas around a big pizza. The mini pizzas were cheese and were great. However, that is not why the pizza was so good. It was because of the topping, the topping is called the BBQ meat feast. It was fantastic!!! I wish I got 2 of them!!! Will order it again!!!
