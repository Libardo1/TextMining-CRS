There must be 20 or more Pizza Hut restaurants dotted around London, but Tripadvisor lumps them together as one - very silly.We went to the branch at 79/80 Oxford Street early on a Saturday evening. It was very busy, but someone came over almost immediately to show us to a table.The waitress was friendly, cheerful and helpful. The food arrived in reasonable time and it was as expected. Not top quality, but you don't expect 5 star food at Pizza Hut.We left a tip of over 15%, which says it all.Whoever was managing the restaurant that evening was doing their job right - a rare occurrence.
