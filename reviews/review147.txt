Wow, I've seen previous service reviews about the Pizza Hut at Cambridge Circus. My partner and I dined there this week and had some of the best service of our whole trip. Our waiter was a Pakistani gentleman (I don't remember his name, but he was very nice) who was really helpful and friendly. We definitely knew about all of the options including the salad and enjoyed our experience there. It's Pizza Hut, so the food is not different than any other. I did really enjoy the view there and we felt very relaxed during the meal.
