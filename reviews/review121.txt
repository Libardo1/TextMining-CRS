During our recent stay in London , my husband and I went to the pizza hut in charing cross road. Although we are Italians and like the pizza made in Italy, we simply adore the thick pizza they do in pizza hut. We went in and we were "welcomed" by this tall girl at the entrance who quickly and with no smile offered us a table in the worst position of the restaurant, where the waiters would walk disturbing us. We said we would have waited for another table and she openly made an annoyed face. WE asked to wait so what was her problem? In a rude manner she told us to "sit there"on a waiting sofa to wait and gave us a menu so "you can choose". She then gave us a table just a little less worse than the first she offered(did it on purpose?). My husband wanted to leave. Dear girl, if you don't like working with people, CHANGE YOUR JOB. Or go to the pizza hut in Edimburgh near the north bridge, meet the kind waiter that works there and learn something.
