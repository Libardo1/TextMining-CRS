I went with my wife to the Leicester Sq. branch. We were seated promptly, but I was dismayed that most of the salad bar was empty and the pasta dishes had gone (it was only 2 p.m.). I mentioned this to the manager, but they still had not been replenished after 20 minutes. Someone then mentioned that there was another salad bar upstairs. When we left, one of the pasta dishes ( the one in white sauce?) had still not been replenished!I wrote to the HQ and got a £10 voucher, but that is not the point. They should have got their act together! Hopefully, they have now.
