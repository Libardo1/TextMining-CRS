Desperate for a half decent meal in a busy city I relented and decided to come here. I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasant service and speed of the food at around 7pm. This place is small inside and just near the junction of Picadilly Circus. I was wanting a pasta dish--ANY like in North America but they don't serve it. The salad bar was also not like "back home" as there were very limited items and at 7pm at night, not looking so good. The only bonus was this salad bar was included in your meal price (ordered large pizzas). The second bonus was we'd heard that they still give free refills like "back home" so that was another reason for coming. Only limited "American" restaurants offer this in the UK. All in all, it was a decent place with a pleasant waitress who was tending to a dozen tables at once and kept it all flowing and decent pizza.
