We don't usually choose Pizza Hut but we wanted somewhere quick and easy and to get out of the torrential rain! We entered and a staff member muttered something which could have been "wait here" as we were then soon afterwards ushered by another person to a table. The restaurant was not busy (unusual for a Saturday evening?). The salad bar was fine. My pizza, ordered with no cheese was very dry and tasted a bit "cardboardy". The toppings were generous though and it looked quite colourful. The other two were happy with their Pizzas.The tables were not the cleanest and we had to change the cutlery. As the restaurant was not busy the staff could have been more proactive in this area.The loos are a bit of a trek away, down 2 sets of stairs and then walk. It gets colder the further you go - there are signs on the doors to identify the return to the restaurant. Loos were basically clean but room for improvement. Our server was friendly and polite.Overall not the best meal.
