I was used with the pizza hut in romania: great pizza, many many kinds of pizza and other types of food, clean location and great service. But in London this is at best an average restaurant. The service is really bad - both times we had problems - they brought us other things than we ordered. There were very few kinds of pizza available and the pizza was really bad, not at all the good pizza I'm used to eat at pizza hut in Romania. Not to talk about the cleanness..Oh! And when I asked to pay with my credit card, the guy told us that we can pay with card but we have to leave the tip cash, since it is not included. We would've leave something anyway but it was disturbing the way he told us that.
