the pizza were crisp, fresh and very delicious!the best part was the extremely interesting salad spread with no extra cost along with your purchase of pizzas!the place was handled well ............the staff was kind and very oblidging!one grievance being that the pizza took far too long to come......i suppose that s why the free salad!
