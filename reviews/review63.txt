Oh my god, it was the worst kids party i have ever done anywhere, big mistake!!! nothing like it was advertised. no chef hats, no colouring in, no one even attended to the kids, i did most of it myself... it was the colliers wood pizza hut... better off doing it at home and would have saved myself £150
