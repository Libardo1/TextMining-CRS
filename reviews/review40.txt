Popped in here on a Saturday night at 7.30pm and as expected it was just about full, but only needing a table for two we were taken straight upstairs onto a table on the back wall inbetween two other tables. Although the tables are close together I wouldn't say that they were TOO close. This is London afterall. Most people around are all speaking different languages anyway so privacy isnt much of an issue! The place had a good lively atmosphere and although the place was full the service was very good and quick.I ordered a mocha but was informed the coffee machine upstairs was broken. Not sure why they couldnt make it from the downstairs machine but was offered a free 'normal' coffee instead which was a welcome suggestion.Had a large BBQ Americano pizza and paid an extra £2.50 for the cheese stuffed crust, very nice indeed and not bad to pay just over £17 for two people.All in all a nice experience when we only had 45 minutes spare before our train home!
