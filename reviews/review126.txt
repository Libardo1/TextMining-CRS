Most Pizza Huts are very similar but I've highlighted this branch for its excellent customer service. Situated in the heart of Theatreland in London, lots of visitors at around 6:00pm will be getting a bite to eat before going on to see a show. The staff know this and they serve quickly and efficiently. Nothing seems too much trouble and they are a very friendly bunch. It's also amazing value with the current free salad offer. It's clean and well maintained- no dirty tables on any of the occasions I've visited- a great team- well managed.
