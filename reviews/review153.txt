This is the second time this has happened, so worth reporting. Went to a Pizza Hut in London (I wont say which one, but it also applies to York) and asked for the £6-7 between 3pm and 5pm deal. The waitress, like the one in York, had not heard of the offer, despite it being widely advertised in the press. Luckily I was armed with a print out of the offer and she went away and enquired of the manager. We got the deal as special menus then appeared. These are obviously not used very often. The offer is fantastic and means you can dine out as a family of 4 for about £30 -35. But you have to kick up a real fuss to get it!!
