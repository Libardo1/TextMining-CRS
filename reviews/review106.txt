This was absolutely terrible, we were told to take any table, once we got comfortable, we were met by a very abrupt and curt waitress, who didn't have much in the way of manners.This was proved when we were rudely demanded to move and was referred to as "Darling" . Also for 10 minutes we were ignored and during that time having to listen to the same waitress loudly talking in her own language on the phone. we will NOT be returning again!
