Visited pizza hut on a tuesday afternoon as have been here before a few times, big mistake. My companion and I were advised of a 15 minute wait which was ok as it was half term and very busy. We were seated in the upstairs area and our order taken. I opted for the buffet lunch whilst my companion had a pizza off of the menu. I wanted to wait and eat so my companion and I could dine at the same time. I was more or less ordered to go downstairs and start eating even though I pointed out that I was waiting for my companions pizza to arrive before I started to eat myself. I got fed up in the end and just did what I was 'ordered' to do. Navigating the stairs was a right pain especially as people were queuing up right up the stairs waiting to be seated. good job I only have a small appetite as I only had to manouvre the stairs and waiting customers twice. We were sat near to the kitchen and could hear quite clearly the staff swearing when coming in and out of the kitchen throughout our visit, what a lovely place to bring children to eat (these were not mild or moderate swear words either), the icing on the cake was when my dining partner was asked to move to the side of the 2 place table as the staff wanted to clear up a minor spillage. This left us nearly eating off of eachothers plates whilst sat on eachothers laps. Not somewhere I will be in a hurry to visit again. Far to cramped and crude staff. I usually like taking a visit to pizza hut but this experience has totally put me off.
