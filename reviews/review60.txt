Pizza hut feltham high street, were very rude and exsreamly helpful they sent me the wrong order and then would not answer the phone to me but i tryed on another phone and they answered straight away. i was ringing on my phone for 45 mins.when akil answered the phone i was basically told if you don't like it don't order from then again. i will never buy any thing from there again good luck to who ever else uses this gomless run restaurant.
