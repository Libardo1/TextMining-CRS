The Pizza hut in Oxford street was the worst Pizza hut i have ever been to ! there was a waitor named Mario ( was not English) who was supposed to serve our table im warning you people if you do see this young lad serving your table make sure to ask for another waitor im being honest. Anyways after bringing the the serve bowl for the salad we requested for plates and you wont believe what hes response was no plates sorry ! In complete shock we were responded what are we suppose to eat on then !! after that he did give us the plate but asked us to take ourselves to our table since we actually came up to him and asked him for it ! That was very rude and we never were treated in that manner at any sit down restaurant we immediately asked to speak to the manager and that waitor did try to interfere and deny hes actions ! anyways the manager asked us to change tables for another waitor to serve us well after being treated in such a manner we chose to leave the place and ended up eating in another pizziria which was not far from Oxford street in Edgware road a place just next to subway and served the best pizza that tasted sooo good and was alot cheaper too !
