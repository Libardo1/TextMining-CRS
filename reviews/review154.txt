The food was exactly what you expect from Pizza Hut. My wife arrived early for the theatre and decided to have pizza. She knew I was going to be late leaving work and I did not arrive until after 6:30. Her service had been fast and efficient and she persuaded me that I had time to eat a pizza rather than go for a sandwich at Pret. Service proved to be fast, efficient and pleasant - thank you Silky. Easily time to eat, without rushing, and walk across the road to the theatre. On the negative side the tables are very close together.
