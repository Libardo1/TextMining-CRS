We popped in here for lunch and all had the help-yourself buffet menu for £7.50 a head. The pizzas are all hot, fresh and very good. The salads were a bit variable – I’ve never considered plain tortilla chips to be a salad, the potato salad was largely mayo and the cherry tomatoes were unripe. The remaining wide choice of salads were good.This is very good value where you can fill your plate as many times as you like with perfectly decent food from the buffet.
