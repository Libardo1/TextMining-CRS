During the summer holidays my wife and I took our two children out for a day in London and during lunch time we ended up in Pizza Hut in Marble Arch. The staff who greeted us were very friendly. We ordered our food which was served very quick and was very fresh and hot. There was a brilliant atmosphere in the restaurant. Our meal cost £40 which was very reasonable and we leave a small tip for the waiters. I strongly recommend taking your family here the children will enjoy the different types of pizzas and a wide varieties of deserts to choose from
