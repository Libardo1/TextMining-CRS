Just came from the Shaftesbury Ave. branch of Pizza Hut in London...ordered a side caesar salad and when I got half way through it I noticed that the lettuce was COVERED in a LOT of dirt. I mentioned it to the waiter and was offered a piece of cheesecake in exchange ?!? As we were in a bit of a hurry to get to a show, I declined (didn't want cheesecake...wanted salad) and asked for the bill. When it arrived, I noticed I was charged for the half eaten salad. When I asked the waiter he said I had to pay for it whether I ate it or not. (Maybe some people like dirt on their salads???) My recommendation is to avoid this place at all costs
