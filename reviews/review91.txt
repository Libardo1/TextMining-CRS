The New Hot Dog Pizza is disgusting, I strongly reccomend you never order it. Also, the BBQ wings are uncooked! I, again, strongly reccomend you never order that either.Based on my personal experience, Pizza Hut USED to be great. Everything was a 10/10. But considering that it used to be great years ago, things change in resturants.So overall, I do not reccomend anyone to eat in Pizza Hut. But according to other reviews, I'd give it a fifty chance. -Joseph
