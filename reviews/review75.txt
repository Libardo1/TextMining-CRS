It was generally good. Had the sea food pizza, they call it king of the coast or something like that. Enjoyed it with free salad. Children had the kids meal. 5 of us, it costed 35 pounds which was not bad. alternative was indian meal, but wife had her cholesterol checked the day before, so its all about salad and low fat food. I had to had eat most of the pizza as i did not check my cholesterol the day before!!
