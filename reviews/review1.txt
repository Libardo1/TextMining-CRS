I Travel a lot and everytime i go to another country i search in google for pizza hut and am going there ( if there is one) to have those amazing garlic breads with cheese. Its very delisious and i never get bored of them.Regarding the quality of the product ,its the same in all pizza huts all over as it is a chain.Only one time i was very disapointed when i traveled to Malasia in Kuala Lumpur and visited a pizza hut in shopping centre and ordered garlic bread and it was the worst thing i have ever eatten.It is very different from other pizza huts.Pizza is great too.
