We often take the kids to Pizza Hut when we're out as it's cheap, we know they'll eat it and the promise of the ice cream factory at the end ensures clean plates all round. Called into the branch on the Strand on a Saturday afternoon and had probably the worse Pizza Hut experience we've ever had.On arrival we were left sitting in the lobby with no acknowledgement and no indication of how long we'd have to wait.The salad bar looked like it hadn't been attended to for quite a while. Half the pots were empty and those that were not had all sorts of other food in them.When our food arrived, the kids meals were about right for them to eat (somewhere between warm and hot) but the pizzas were cold. Sent the Pizzas back to be warmed up and they came back hot but now shriveled and almost too crispy to cut.After the mains were eaten the kids went down to visit the ice cream factory. Only one of the three toppings available and half the sauces missing. Checked with the manager and apparently they just had nothing else available.So in summary :-- Poor reception- Sub-standard salad bar- Luke-warm pasta- Cold Pizza- Most of the ice cream factory un-stockedLuckily the manager made an appropriate adjustment to our bill but it was still not the experience we have come to expect from Pizza Hut.Pizza Hut usually give a great family service but our experience at the Strand was not what we expected and was really not good enough.
