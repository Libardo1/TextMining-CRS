We went to Pizza Hut at Soho (near to Odeon) with my friend and ordered a large pizza to share. I liked it and the salad bar, as well.One of the waitresses was really nice, the others also ok.The only small problem was, that for me the hot chocolat they made was too sweet, so basically I could not drink it, and the basement floor we were seated was really cold after a while. Anyways nice experience!
