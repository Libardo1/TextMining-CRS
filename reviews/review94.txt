A good standard Pizza Hut which has managed to squeeze it's way onto Leicester Square in a clever way making the most of underground space. As a lunch time venue it is cheap and cheerful for London and can be recommend for people on the go seeing the captial. As a dinner venue it is more expensive and I would suggest one of the proper restaurant as at normal prices you won't see a vast difference between say Pizza Hut and Pizza Express but quite a difference in food and service quality.
