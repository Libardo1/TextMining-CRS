I stopped here with two friends for a quick bite to eat while on a tour of London. The food was fantastic, very reasonably priced and the server was so kind and helpful. I would recommend getting the salad bar (free with most meals) and take your time eating. We were never rushed to finish our meal and were able to enjoy leisurely conversation. At the end, when we were short on time, our server was very helpful.
