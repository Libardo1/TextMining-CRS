Went here on New Year's Day for a late lunch whilst the New Year Parade 2013 was happening literally on the street outside. There was a queue to get in but the guy on the door took names and party numbers and advised how long a wait to expect (5-7 mins for us). It was more like 10 mins but in the meantime we perused the menu in the outside window so we could order as soon as we reached the table. We were shown to a table upstairs so had a fairly good view of the parade too - bonus! We were offered drinks straightaway (chose a hot chocolate and latte) and ordered a regular pizza each a few mins later - veg supreme for me, cajun chicken pizza for hubby. I didn't catch the name of our waiter but he was exceptional. Kept us informed, even asked us to let him know if drinks weren't to a good enough standard as they had a new drinks machine (which was being updated shortly). Hubby said his hot chocolate was ok but my latte was lovely. Excellent service, tasty, hot food. Perfect!
