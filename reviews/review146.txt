Whilst in London we enjoyed a Sunday afternoon visit to Pizza Hut, Covent Garden. The restaurant is in a cellar, of I think a bank. We were greeted and seated quickly. My husband enjoyed his sizzling prawn starter, we shared a garlic bread and a very large pizza. They did half and half different toppings for us. Great choice of free salad and also had refillable cokes. The whole meal came to £12 each!!! We could not fault the service and left happy with the whole experience, food and price. We have had a similar experience at our local Pizza Hut at Middlebrook retail park in Bolton. Hope that all Pizza Hut staff are trained to a consistant standard as good as these two branches.
