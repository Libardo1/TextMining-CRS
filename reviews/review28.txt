| had a Lunchtime Buffet with All you Can Eat Pizza, Pasta and Salad at pizza hut near to Madame Tussauds .The service was really nice,unfortunately my friend found a long blond hair into a pizza so we informed quickly the manager and she replaced the wrong pizza with a good one. The atmosphere was nice and quiet so we really enjoyed the lunch despite the hair part!
