I was on woderful day out with friends in London fromdaily routine time. We were feeling hungry so we went to pizza hut near Madam Tussads as its my favourite place in India as well. We all opted for bufet lunch menu ,which is real value for money.But, when we went to take food from buffet...the black jerk shouted on us instead of requesting or guiding through it. I was taking some chocolates as I thought 'part of buffet' the jerk screamed on me in font of my friends. That was really embarrassing moment for me ever in my life. That bugger don't have any etiquette's or at all. When I asked him that is that your standard of hospitality and communication with your guest, he replied me rudely that I am the owner of this pizza hut.' You can do what ever you want.'Seen and stayed in many hotels but this was nasty moment in my life....even though I paid more than 70 pounds.Decided not to visit Pizza hut again in my life until they brush up hospitality skill of their staff.
