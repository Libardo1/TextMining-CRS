Went to Browells lane ,Feltham delivery. Requested fr a large pizza in two small boxes very nicely......the guy treated me lyk an unwanted customer nd refused ...I told him i cnt fit the large box in my bag.....nd he went further rude...nd stubborn....Wen i told him he ws rude....he says, very annoyingly 'thank you'....horrible standards....guys were nt wearing gloves while dressing the base....Bad nd nvt going tere again...will reccomend the same fr everyone..
