We ordered one pizza to takeaway from the Charlton branch (2 min drive from our house). No pizza after an hour so we phoned up. No record of our order. Put on hold roughly 5 times, a different person answering the phone after each hold. Had to explain the situation each time. Then they finally found the order and said it was a collection. It wasn't. They said they would send out a new one. Sent the old one which was cold and tasted like cardboard. No apology and told that we couldn't get a refund. Shocking service and disgusting food, pizza hut should be embarrassed.
