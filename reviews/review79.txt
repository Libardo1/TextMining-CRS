I was down in London with my family and we all went to Pizza Hut in Russell Square, southampton row, after a wait for a table as there were 7 of us, we finally sat down to our meal and I have to say the wait was worth it. We all enjoyed what we ordered, no mistakes in the order and we had to take a doggie bag home.
