Went here as i usually really enjoy Pizza Hut pizzas. Not actually a big pizza fan but have always had superb pizzas when i have had them in the north. Could not fault the staff member serving us he could not have been nicer. However went to the salad bar which was looking tired and empty not at all tempting. The pizza arrived quickly but was really bland and not at all thin and crispy and the crust was huge, they actually sent me a large pizza instead of medium as they had run out of that size! Yet people who ordered after me seemed to be getting medium sized pizzas so i am not sure how that worked. It actually was quite off putting looking at a large pizza for one especially as i could not take the left overs home so actually ate more than i wanted and did not enjoy it at all. They did only charge me for a medium size but my friends looked far more appetising than mine less crust more topping i really wish i had gone to pizza express across the road now. The saving grace was the dessert. Would not venture back here far better places to eat nearby.
