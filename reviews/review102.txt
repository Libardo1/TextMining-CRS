Pizza Hut isn't exactly foreign food to me. We have loads back home and I'm not a big fan. I don't know what they do different but the Pizza Huts in London are DELICIOUS. They are so good that I will only eat Pizza Hut in London now. It's not just the food. They treat Pizza Hut like an actual dining experience instead of basically fast food and I've never had bad service.
