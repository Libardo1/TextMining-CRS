I have been to this restaurant twice this year, I love the location specially on summer as they have exterior tables.However, I was very disappointed both times, with the toilets specially it was so filthy with toilet papers everywhere and stank really bad, I have tried to speak to a waitress who was passing by and her answer was: "the toilet is not my job". same happened with the salad section, there was empty cups of sauces and no sweetcorn, and when I asked one member of staff they rudely said there was someone else dealing with that section, I waited like 10 mnts for someone to help but I just got tired of waiting and went back to my seat as I had my husband waiting for me outside.Our table waitress was very kind, but the restaurant was very busy and I felt everyone really nervous, we could see it was not under control as the floor was completely dirty, and food was not perfect.Overall, I believe it needs a better management. A good manager will rock that place up as the location really helps! I hope this review will help them to make better changes and to look forward to solving the problems listed above. I would not recommend this place unless changes are made.
