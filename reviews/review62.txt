Not exactly a place you'd want to go for some fine dining, but if you want a decent meal that isn't going to cost the earth then Pizza Hut is the place to go to.It's pretty basic and nothing fancy, the waiters and waiteress' are all lovely and helpful, the atmosphere of each restaurant varies but all is welcoming.Perfect if you just want a quick bite to eat before going off and doing something else during your trip.
