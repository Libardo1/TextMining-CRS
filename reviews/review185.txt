If you didn't know (will be shocked if you dont) Pizza Hut is a mazzive brand that has it's resturants located all around the country. Not alot to say really if you've been to a pizza hut before then you'll know what to expect. I would advise going to pizza express if you are willing to spend a little more money. On the other hand pizza hut is great for teenagers who just want some grub
