I had dinner there last week. |The food was good but the service was beyond bad. I had to wait a long time, 45 minutes, to get my food. The salad bar was included in the price of my meal but this was not conveyed to me, either by the staff or the menu. When I was done I could get no ones attention in order to pay the bill and leave. It was all round bad service with no apologies.
