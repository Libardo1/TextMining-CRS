My kids love Pizza Hut & not just for the pizza. My husband shared a pizza with my 12 year old son, my daughter & I had pasta. We all had a drink (2 of which were part of the pasta meal deal) & both kids had the cookie dough dessert. It may be that I'm a typical thrifty northerner but no change from £60 I thought was a little steep for fast food. The fact that people were queing to get in meant we were a little rushed which I didn't like either.
