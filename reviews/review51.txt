When staying in London at the end of July/ beginning of August, we were sad to see that the Pizza Hut in Covent Garden had closed. As an alternative, we decided to go to the Pizza Hut in Leicester Square. We wish we hadn’t as it was the worst Pizza Hut we had been to. On the day we visited, we had done a lot of walking around London so were ready for both food and drink when we arrived. We were told we would have to wait for a table, although a table was found for us fairly quickly. We were sat in a small dining area at ground floor level, however when visiting the toilet at basement level, I noticed that there was a lot more tables in the restaurant down there. We then ordered our drinks which took ages to arrive, certainly not what you want on a hot day after walking several miles!Once we had ordered our pizzas, we were told we could help ourselves to salad. Mum did the honours and said how badly positioned the salad table was. There was very little room to walk around it, and the salad itself wasn’t that nice either. When the pizzas finally arrived, we were far from impressed. They didn’t seem to be as tasty as we have experienced from Pizza Hut in the past. In fact, they actually brought out the wrong pizza to start with and we had to point out that it wasn’t the one that we had ordered.Overall, we were very disappointed. We would eat in a Pizza Hut again (there are plenty around the area), but we would avoid the one in Leicester Square.
