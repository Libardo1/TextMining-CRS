on walking in this resteraunt did not smell or appear very clean. quite cold inside and the salad bar was very dissapointing and off putting. hardly any choice and the pasta and coleslaw was stuck to the serving spoons and was sloppy and slimy. staff alright though, had better pizza at othe pizza hut resteraunts, very dissapointing.
