Went to the bayswater branch during the weekend and had a very satisfying lunch. Ordered a veggie supreme between 2 with garlic bread and we got 2 bowls of eat as much as you can salad from the salad bar. As always the pizza was upto Pizza Hut standard - yummy and satisfying.Staff were very welcoming and polite. Will definitely go to this branch again. Atmosphere is relaxed, good choice of music too
