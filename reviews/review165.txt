We don't often get to go to pizza hut as there isn't one in our home town so though we would treat ourselves. On going in where were a number of stairs of which a lady with a pushchair was trying to negotiate the stairs going up not a easy task so must be a issue for people with pushchairs, wheelchairs for example. Now to the food they had a new starter garlic prawns with cheese, lovely. The pizza's were lacking cheese of the usual amount. The puddings well mine was nice which was profiterolls but my husbands which was white chocolate cookie dough was very sweet but he was not impressed with it. On the plus side the male waiter was friendly even though he tried to seat us between two other couples which i wasn't having any of it we went for a meal not to be squeezed in like sardines
