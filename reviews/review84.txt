This has to be the worst Pizza hut I've eaten in.Bearing in mind the restaurant was virtually empty there can be no excuse for the salad bar looking such a mess. The pizza took over 30 minutes to arrive which was sent back to be cooked properly. Surely a thin and crispy base should be exactly that, not thin and soft!When the waitress asked me if everything was OK, she didn't seem to care when I pointed out how messy the salad bar was and the fact I'd had to return my pizza to be cooked properly!I think I'll give this one a miss in future!
