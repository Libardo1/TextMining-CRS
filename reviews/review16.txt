My son and I went to the above pizza hut today, we went to the buffet session which is between 12 noon and 15:00. It was a pleasant afternoon not crowded at all. The salad buffet was always well topped up as were the pizza's, pleasantly surprised as the pizza's were of good quality and some lovely flavours and options. We would definitely go again for a pleasant afternoon and decent slices of pizza.
