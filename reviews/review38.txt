Whilst visiting London recently we were looking for somewhere to eat and relax in between sightseeing and shopping.. Pizza Hut Piccadilly was perfectly located, just off Piccadilly Circus. Upon our arrival at the restaurant we were greeted by the host who was baying back the crowds at the front door, and we waited a very short time before being shown to our table on the upper floor of the hotel. We decided to have a real feast and get bottomless drinks and the lunch buffet and all under £20 for two people! There was a number of different pizzas n the buffet as well as two types of pasta and a wide variety of salad stuff! Would definitely recommend and return again.
