Decent enough for 11pm food on a Friday evening !We had seen a show in the west end so had missed our dinner. Pizza Hut was a good fast food option.I had the garlic prawns to start which were better than I thought they would be. My daughter tried the ultimate garlic bread. My spicy pizza was indeed spicy just how I like it whilst my daughter opted for the traditional Hawaiian which she also enjoyed.Typical Pizza Hut with no atmosphere but good enough for fast food before bed after a long day.
