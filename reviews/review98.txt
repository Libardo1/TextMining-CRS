The only value for money place to eat quality food and not feel over charged.The pizza was great and the cheese triangles were tasty.The free salad bowl with every meal was a very good deal and unexpected offer.Next to Piccadilly circus it was £24 for a large pizza starter and three drinks and 2 free salad bowls.
