Me and my partner ordered online take away form your brunch. Firstly, the website and sms message which my partner received regarding special offer suggested, that the order will be 'delivery'. However after submiting order, suddenly it was only 'take away', so we had to go and get the pizza in the brunch. The online ordering system was difficult to get through because we had to register at least three times to place the order. That all would be fine, but after getting to the restaurant, staff was very confused and obviously was not sure how to handle a take away order, we had to talk to three people to eventually get it. When we finally got the pizza and successfully got home, we opened it and found out, that on my partner's Hawaiian pizza was no pineapple, which was actually ordered and paid double. What a paradox. This way I would like to thank Pizza Hut for a lovely dinner.
