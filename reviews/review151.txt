This Pizza Hut on Leicester Square in London, had eat as much you want, at lunchtime.With the high price of softdrinks its not so cheap anyway, but its a nice concept to pick what you want from the buffet on different pizzaslices.It worked ok, even if the plates was small so you had to go many times.New employed waitress (as she told us), that was ok, and as it was many different pizza, we all found something we liked.A big Minus was in the vegetables, saladbuffet, the already sliced carrot, the restaurant gets it like that said a small chef, and it tasted more like woodchips, and the corn was not much better, so it was left on the plate..So dont take a lot from the vegetables, the saladbuffet, be sure to taste it in small bits first.The place gets 4 points because of ok friendly staff and the pizzaslices this time.
