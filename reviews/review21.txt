I regretted it when my husband and I tried to order Pizza Hut for the first time, after years being fully satisfied with Domino. It was raining but no excuse for that, the delivery was late for about 1 hour, and following that food was completely cold. I have to say the nearest Pizza Hut store from my house is just next to a Domino store, while we got quick service and hot food everytime we order Domino. No wonder why they always lose for Domino. Will never order again.
