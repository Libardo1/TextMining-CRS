We we on our way for an early supper to Planet Holywood only to find it was a 55 minute wait and the children pleaded to go to the Pizza Hut next door.The decor and building are a little tired and uninspiring but the service was good and prices were very reasonable for London as each main course came with free access to the salad bar.there was also an option for wine where if you bought 2 x large glasses the bottle came free.The children loved the 'all you can eat' ice cream bar.All in all this is not a fine dining experience but if you have children and want a reasonably priced meal with children then this is a good option and despite other comment we had excellent service+ if you are worried about the calories that had a wonderful pizzerietta at 500 calories !
