Came here for lunch while shopping on oxford street. Ordered two drinks, staff werent very fast to be honest and it was hard to get there attention, maybe there just wasnt enough staff on that day but apart from that staff were reli friendly :-). We Shared a nachos for starter which were really good as always, shared a medium veggie sizzler with my partner for main which we both enjoyed, he also went to the salad bar and he had no complaints. Nice food. would be back .
