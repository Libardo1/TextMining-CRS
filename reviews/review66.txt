Tried to make a booking today at Pizza Hut at Cow Lane - Watford today - need to train staff to listen and answer customer enquiry's. Would not take the booking and hung up.... really good for customer relations....... On the up side called Pizza Hut at Jarmans Hemel - very good staff and have secured the booking.... well done Hemel :)
