I have dealt with this person several times in the past; over the phone, and she has always been very rude which I always ignore but today she took it to a different level. Today, I was on the phone with her and another call came in on another line in their shop, she put me on hold to take that call without saying anything to me. I complained about it when she finished with the other call and demanded to speak to the manager, her answer to me was "are you going to order or not?" in a harsh; bullying tone. I was so shocked when she said to me that she was the manager. I went down to the shop to get an explanation\apology, she refused to apologize but rather called the police. THE MANAGER AT PIZZA HUT WOODFORD GREEN LONDON is very rude with a poor attitude and a shocking and disgraceful customer service.
