This was the first Pizza Hut restaurant we had ever been to and what a mistake. Food was bland and only suitable for children. They say you can fill your salad bowl as often as you like. Who would want to? Iceberg lettuce and other truly awful fare with uninteresting dressings.The joke comes at the end when the bill asks you to visit the website if you were made to smile. Of course I did not get a response to my comments.How can be Pizza Hut be so big around the world? Do people really like this stuff? Well I am amazed.
