Had a reservation at this pizza hut (henrietta street - covent garden) on Tuesday evening before heading to the theatre. We walked in and were shown to our table - only for my wife to see a mouse running across the floor! Needless to say we walked straight back out! I really would not advise going here! If there was a mouse running across the restaurant floor, chances are there are more mice running across the kitchen floor! we were gobsmacked! I have never seen a rodent in a restaurant until now! AVOID UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ILL AND HAVE MICE RUNNING ACROSS YOUR FEET!
