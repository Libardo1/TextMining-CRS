I arrived and eventually found the disabled parking at the side of the restaurant -- not near the door and the footpath was unusable.Inside we were being shown to a table far away from the buffet. I asked to sit at a nearer table -- it was for 4 and we were only 2 - as I had trouble walking. We were told we could but also told we were taking up too many seats!! it was only half full!!! The menus were virtually thrown at us.No severs arrived so I went to the buffet -- I was told to return to my table so my order was taken and I would get plates for buffet. Needless to say nothing arrived. When I got a dish for the salad from the kitchen I went to the salad bar. It was virtually empty -- hardly any food -- it was also filthy with food scattered all over the buffet. I then went to the pizza bar -- again little food and what was there was cold and sad looking. Yes the buffet was only about £7 but even at this price it was terrible. We then struggled back to the disabled parking having to walk in the road and walk round all the cars parked close to the door. In last time I went to Pizza Hut was about 10 years ago --- nothing has changed. This will be my last visit.
