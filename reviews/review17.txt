This is not our first visit too the pizza hut strand !! the service is poor !! the staff are friendly , on this occasion , my wife took our daughter to the toilet on arrival, its was disgusting :( not been cleaned for hours !! we told the staff , she went back down later still the same so had to walk along too mcdonalds ( say no more ) second complaint i have a medical condition so always have children's menu ask for the spaghetti , but ask if could have it hotter as i was an adult !! also asked for drink which is included but told no because i was over 12yrs so for £3.99 had a warm bowl of spaghetti my tip give it a miss please note this is only my opinion on the plus the pizza was hot !!love to hear your feed back
