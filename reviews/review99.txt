Myself and my boyfriend always scout for a Pizza Hut wherever we go, so were delighted to finally find this one as they seem to prefer Pizza Express in London for some reason..Upon arriving we had to wait quite a while until the staff actually noticed us and decided to seat us. We were seated next to another couple, and the woman decided she wanted to stare at me almost constantly throughout the entire duration of our meal. I understand that this was not the fault of the restaurant, but when we asked to move we were told that this wouldn't be possible, even though there were ample free tables around us..As my attention was focused mainly on this woman who was annoying the hell out of me, i failed to realize that we had been given the wrong sized pizzas. Half way through, i noticed that they were both the same size, whereas i always order a medium, and my partner a large.We alerted the waiter who told us that there was nothing he could do. Upon hearing this my boyfriend requested to speak to the manager.The manager also stated that there was nothing he could do. I was unimpressed by this as it was clear that this was the fault of the waitress who took out order. We were told that we had to "pay for what we eat". I'm not being funny but i'd only eaten three slices - so technically i should only be charged for that?!After a lot of waiting and "just a moment"s, we were still told that there was nothing they could do. Not even an apology.
