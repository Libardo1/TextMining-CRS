Began the experience by having a long wait at the door, some girls in front of us must have been waiting at least half an hour as we were there for 20 mins, and still hadn't been seated. There were plenty of seating space however the tables hadnt been cleared. The staff sat us down at a table which still hadn't been fully cleared and took our drinks order which they then forgot to bring to us as they began serving someone else theirs who had ordered after us. The only reason i feel they even remembered the drinks was due to my comical remark to my boyfriend about it. Following this the lady took my boyfriends food order and was about to walk off when he called her back as i hadnt ordered my food. when i placed my order she laughed and commented saying its too big for me, when i confirmed it was what i wanted she just smirked and walked off. Following this, one of the customers dropped a glass vingerette and was left standing there without any staff offering to help clean it up.overall very disappointed.
