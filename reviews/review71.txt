We went to Pizza Hut, London. It had mouthwatering deserts and a great selection of food. Sides included of:chicken strips, potato wedges and cheesy garlic bread. Service was quite slow. Could choose amount of pizza or pasta or salad. Ice cream factory was delicious and could load as much flavour or topping as you want. Waiters where shuttle. Overall I'd score it seven and a half out of ten
