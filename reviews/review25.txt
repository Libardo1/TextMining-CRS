As always the food at Pizza Hut is fantastic! But since it's half term, our family was looking forward to a nice delicious meal at Pizza Hut, in park royal today. So as always queues are going to be long since it's half term, but what has really annoyed my family trip was how unaware the staff were. Our family had to wait exactly 40 minutes just to get a seat. But, the reason this had really annoyed my family and I is because there were just groups of people who had kept pushing in front of us, saying to the members of staff that they were booked. It was clear that not all of them were booked because, there was a woman who had asked one of the staff if they could go first since they has such a massive group. But the staff were to weak enough to say no. The staff should have noticed that it's first come first serve. Not due to the amount if people there were. I recommend that they should have a reservation list on the people who were booked. This would then make sure that the people are not liying and that we all are equal. I hope that all Pizza Hut restaurants read this and make sure that they follow this advice. I'm hoping in the future that my family and I won't be disappointed again, and will be keeping an eye on the staff.
