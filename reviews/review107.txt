Being a tourist hotspot, this is inevitably a very busy restaurant. There does not seem to be enough staff and food service was very slow. Many people come here before seeing a musical in the West End, so allow plenty of time. Staff are so rushed that service is impersonal. Food is average Pizza Hut. I enjoyed my meal and can't really complain about it. It is basically the same as any other Pizza Hut branch, it was just let down by the slow service.
