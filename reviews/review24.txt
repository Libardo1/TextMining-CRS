My dad and I popped in for lunch a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed our feed.Bottomless salad bowl, average service, but business as usual in relation to the food.We used to eat here years ago, and always seem to be satisfied having eaten here.Never fails, initial service took a while but was fine afterwards...
