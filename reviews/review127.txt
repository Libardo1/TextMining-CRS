I ate here on my own on a Sunday night whilst travelling through London on business but had a nice meal. I was able to get a table for one, which can sometimes be an issue but not here. The free salad is a nice touch as with all Pizza Huts and the menu is the same as everywhere else. The prices were a little higher but, you are eating in Leicester Square right in the heart of the tourist zone of London so you should expect to pay higher prices. The atmosphere was really good here, the staff were great and service was fast and efficient.
