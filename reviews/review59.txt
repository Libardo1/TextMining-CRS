We were out for a walk in London and decided to stop in for a pizza. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The service was quick and the food was fresh and tasty. Free salad bar was fresh and regularly topped up. The draft pepsi was a bit flat though ... maybe need to get your equipment checked?On the whole, a good visit though. Thank you
