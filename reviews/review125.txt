Pizza Hut over the UK had the same experience. They have buffet during the week, so you can have a slice of every kind of pizza and eat until you are full. The chicken wings are excellent. The right combination of barbecue and peri-peri. The service is good and they are polite. I 100% recommend them. Oh plus free salad on weekdays if you buy the buffet plan.
