This was one of best affordable meal for a family while on summer holidays. It was fast and easy to help yourself to the salad buffet. The salad buffet catered for all diet requirements.The pizzas came fast and was filling. The only issue was that the low calorie pizza was so thin that it would have been easier to eat it with your hand rather than attempting to use the knife.
