We went to the pizza hut in leicester square, London. Our daughter has coeliac disease and they were able to provide her with a gluten free pizza. There were no issues with cross contamination and she was fine afterwards. The only downside was that the base was an adult portion so there was rather a lot for her to get through. We would definately take her to pizza hut again.
