**A Text Mining Approach to analyzing Customer reviews on travel rating sites**

All the codes are present in the repo numbered 1 to 5  
Unfortunately, the codes might require a bit of cleanup and optimization, though it is well commented and easy to understand.  
I know this can be made much more efficient in a cleaner code, but this code was writter over multiple sessions. I'll be happy if someone could make a contribution to the cleaning and optimization :)
